# Java Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of Java projects demonstrating various programming concepts and skills. Each project focuses on a different aspect of Java development, from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics like networking and data persistence.

## Projects:

### 1. Enhanced Console-based Calculator

**Description:** A console-based calculator that extends basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with scientific calculations (e.g., square root, exponentiation) and unit conversions (e.g., temperature, currency).
**Key Learning:** Basic Java syntax, methods, error handling, and additional mathematical operations.

### 2. Simple Contact Management System

**Description:** A command-line contact management system built with Java. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts, storing information like name, phone number, and email address in memory.
**Key Learning:** Basic CRUD operations, user input/output, array or ArrayList data structures.

### 3. Library Management System with Data Persistence (SQLite)

**Description:** An enhanced Library Management System that includes features like user accounts, book recommendations, and optionally, integration with an external book information API. Data persistence is managed using SQLite.
**Key Learning:** Data persistence with SQLite, API integration (optional), user management.

### 4. Bank Account Management System with Unit Testing (JUnit)

**Description:** An extension of a Bank Account Management System that incorporates unit testing using JUnit. It includes comprehensive test cases to validate core functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transaction history.
**Key Learning:** Unit testing, test-driven development, software testing principles.

### 5. Real-time Chat Application with Java Socket Programming

**Description:** A real-time chat application developed using Java Socket Programming. It enables multiple users to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive instant updates, demonstrating fundamental networking concepts.
**Key Learning:** Networking fundamentals, socket programming, real-time communication.
